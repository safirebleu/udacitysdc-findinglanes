    "# Udacity Lesson 1: Finding Lanes in Video\n",
    "by Tim Chen\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the concepts learned in the first section to identify lanes on the road.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We first start with the input frame which is an RGB image of (540, 960, 3):\n",
    "![](lesson1/figure1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is then 'flattened' into a monochrome grayscale in order to simplify processing:\n",
    "![](lesson1/figure2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove some noise from the input, we use a Gaussian function to smooth the image to find large changes in pixel intensity that would indicate an edge. The following example has been exaggerated in order to visualize the smoothing effect (kernel=31):\n",
    "![](lesson1/figure3.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "Using moderate threshold values (Low=1, High=100), the Canny function give a typical 'edge-detected' image: \n",
    "![](lesson1/figure4-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning the threshold parameters (Low=150, High=200) to maximize high-contrasting regions, we can filter out more of the image in order to find areas of largest transitions or edges:\n",
    "![](lesson1/figure4-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a mask is created to remove areas (not in white) that will not be considered in detecting the space of the lane... \n",
    "![](lesson1/figure5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "...it is then applied to the Canny image in order to isolate the lane markings within the masked region:\n",
    "![](lesson1/figure6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the Hough Transform, will allows us to determine which pixels that fall roughly on a line. The function will determine if enough pixels form a line based on the threshold parameters declared at the beginning of the function. Pixels that don't meet the criteria for a line are filtered out and the remaining pixels are replaced with a line. Re-drawing the image with end-points of the lines will give us a clean image we can overlay:\n",
    "![](lesson1/figure7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result of overlaying the Hough Transform image over the original input image will verify if we've correctly 'detected the lane':\n",
    "![](lesson1/figure8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this gives a basic algorithm for detecting lanes. Because of its static masks and input parameters, it might be a useful algorithm for only keeping vehicles evenly within the lane. Dynamic range lighting processing and variable masks with variable parameters will help make this algorithm more effective in finding lanes in more complex situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the code to process the \"solidWhiteRight.mp4\" and \"solidYellowLeft.mp4\" videos to apply the algorithm above to detect the lanes on a straight highway:"
